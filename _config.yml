  I am a research fellow for the UK's National Centre for Earth Observations (NCEO), based in the School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh. My research focus on combining process-models of terrestrial ecosystems with observations to improve our understanding of ecosystem state, function and underlying traits. A key software tool for my research is the CARbon DAta-MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM) and the DALEC suite of intermediate complexity models (Link to repo). CARDAMOM is a Bayesian model-data fusion (MDF) approach which utilised an Adaptive Proposal-Markov Chain Monte Carlo (AP-MCMC) allowing us to calibrate DALEC independently for every location across the globe. The DALEC suite of models simulate the terrestrial C-cycle at a range of process-representation complexities. In combination, these tools allow for the (i) diagnosing where and when we are most uncertain in our understanding of the terrestrial C-cycle, (ii) quantify the information content of ecologically relevant observations, (iii) identify strategies to improve our confidence and (iv) evaluate alternate hypotheses embedded in models by confronting them with observations.
