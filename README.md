I am a research fellow for the UK's National Centre for Earth Observations (NCEO), based in the School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh.
My research focus on combining process-models of terrestrial ecosystems with observations to improve our understanding of ecosystem state, function and underlying traits.
