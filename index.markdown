I am a terrestrial ecologist and research fellow for the UK's National Centre for Earth Observations (NCEO), based in the School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh. 

My research focuses on understanding how terrestrial ecosystem function across site to global scales. My primary research tool is model-data fusion (MDF), by which a diverse array of observation, made across scales, are combined with process-models of terrestrial ecosystems. In combination, these tools allow for the (i) diagnosing where and when we are most uncertain in our understanding of the terrestrial C-cycle, (ii) quantify the information content of ecologically relevant observations, (iii) identify strategies to improve our confidence and (iv) evaluate alternate hypotheses embedded in models by confronting them with observations.

A key software tool for my research is the CARbon DAta-MOdel fraMework ([CARDAMOM](https://github.com/GCEL/CARDAMOM)) and the DALEC suite of intermediate complexity models CARDAMOM is a Bayesian model-data fusion (MDF) approach which utilised an Adaptive Proposal-Markov Chain Monte Carlo (AP-MCMC) allowing us to calibrate DALEC independently for every location across the globe. The DALEC suite of models simulate the terrestrial C-cycle at a range of process-representation complexities.
